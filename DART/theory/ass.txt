B1. What is inheritance?

   ->       Inheritance is defined as the process at deriving the properties and characteristics as another class.

                Syntax :-
                          class parent_class{
                                                ...
                                            } 

                          class child_class extends parent_class{
                                                                    ...
                                                                }
