-->> index each element has its index number that tells the element position in  the list.

-->> the index number is used to access the particular element from the list, such as list_name[index].
-->> the list indexing starts from 0 to length-1 where length denotes the numbers of the element present in the list.

  -->> Types of list

                best ex is class

        syntax
            
           class <classname>{
                  // different data member
                  // diffrent member function

0-->>  abstraction

             it is represent only few information not allocated background information.
             when we use inheritance - child can access all the properties of parent class but using of acstraction concept is only acheieve with abstract class

abstract class whice is contain only abstract method






abstract method which is contain only method declaration - no implimatation (without body)
